mlan v3

This is a personal software project from 1994-1996. The first version was a simple 1 to 1 chat (LAN2LAN).
The second one was the final version (MLANV3) which allowed many people in many chat rooms as well as "messages" and password protected aliases.

There is a set of libraries used in the final project that I am unsure if I can post due to totally unknown licensing. I absolutely paid for them so I could use them personally and in my compiled projects, but I cannot include them here alongside my code

As you can see, the header in each file is ... unhelpful
